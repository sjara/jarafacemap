# jarafacemap

*Jarafacemap* is a fork of [FaceMap](https://github.com/MouseLand/facemap ) (version 0.2.0), a tool for processing videos developed by Carsen Stringer and others. In the [Jaramillo lab](https://jaralab.uoregon.edu/), we wanted to have a light interface to look through videos and apply simple measurements (including pixel change measurements), without all the complexity of FaceMap v1.0.

For details, see the [original documentation of FaceMap v0.2.0](https://github.com/MouseLand/facemap/blob/b6334475d71179d440ef3b5c51c7dd93197a5504/README.md)

This fork also fixes a few bugs related to saving and loading ROIs that existed in that old version of FaceMap.
